   - Guest mode support

2. **Task Management**
   - Task creation with detailed forms (42KB implementation)
   - Task browsing and filtering
   - Task details view with rich information display
   - Task application system
   - User's own tasks management

3. **Messaging System**
   - Real-time chat between users
   - Channel-based messaging
   - Chat list with conversations
   - Unread message indicators support

4. **Payment Integration**
   - Billplz payment gateway integration
   - Payment completion handling
   - Deep linking for payment callbacks
   - Web and mobile payment URL handling

5. **User Interface**
   - Material 3 design system
   - Custom numpad and keyboard overlays
   - Responsive design for multiple platforms
   - Dark/Light theme support (currently using light theme)

6. **Navigation & Routing**
   - Complex routing with nested routes
   - Authentication-based redirects
   - Deep linking support
   - Guest mode routing logic

### 🔄 Partially Implemented

1. **Profile Management** - Basic structure present but may need enhancement
2. **Onboarding Flow** - Structure exists but content unclear

### ❓ Status Unknown/Needs Investigation

1. **Testing Coverage** - Only basic widget test template exists
2. **Error Handling** - Implementation level unclear
3. **Offline Support** - No clear indication of offline capabilities
4. **Push Notifications** - Mentioned in requirements but implementation unclear

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with feature-based organization
2. **Type Safety**: Heavy use of Freezed for immutable models and proper typing
3. **State Management**: Proper use of Riverpod with async handling
4. **Code Generation**: Automated code generation for models and providers
5. **Cross-platform Support**: Full platform coverage (mobile, web, desktop)
6. **Real-time Features**: Proper integration with Supabase for live updates

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Testing**: Very limited test coverage (only basic widget test)
2. **Documentation**: Code could benefit from better inline documentation
3. **Error Handling**: Need to assess error handling patterns across features
4. **Performance**: Large files (42KB create_task_screen.dart) may need refactoring
5. **Configuration Management**: API keys are in code (should use environment variables)

## Security Considerations

### Current Setup
- ✅ Supabase authentication with proper session management
- ✅ Proper routing guards for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- ⚠️ API keys exposed in source code (should use environment variables)
- ✅ Guest mode implementation for limited access

### Recommendations
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Implement proper input validation
3. Add rate limiting considerations
4. Review Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Web Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Configuration**: Simple SPA routing with catch-all rewrites
